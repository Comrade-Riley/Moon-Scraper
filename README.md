# Moon-Scraper

Scrapes the date of the next full moon off of https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/@220244 and sends the result as a notification.

# How to run it

I run the file with a .sh file that opens minecraft so evertime I open minecraft it tells me when the next full moon is, you can do the same thing but with a diffrent app or just run it by doing python3 '<path>/Moon_scraper/main.py'
  
 # What a .sh file would look like
 open '<whatever app you'd like to open>'
 python3 <path>/Moon_scraper/main.py'
